## AWS Services Utilized

**Amazon S3:**
- Stores static assets such as images, videos, and documents.
- Provides scalable storage with high availability.

**Amazon API Gateway:**
- Serves as a fully managed service to create, deploy, and maintain APIs.
- Acts as the entry point for client requests, routing them to appropriate backend services.

**AWS Lambda:**

- Executes backend business logic in a serverless environment.
- Scales automatically with the volume of incoming requests.

**Amazon DynamoDB:**

- Provides a fully managed NoSQL database for storing user data, product catalogs, and session information.
- Offers low-latency data access at any scale.

**Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**

- Manages relational databases for transactional data.
- Ensures high availability and automated backups.

**AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):**

- Controls access to AWS resources through roles and policies.
- Ensures secure interactions between services.

**Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS):**

- Facilitates messaging and notifications for events like order confirmations.
- Supports multiple communication protocols, including email and SMS.


---
## How It All Works Together:
- A customer visits your **website (S3)** to browse items.
- When they click “Add to Cart” or “Buy Now,” the request goes to the **front desk (API Gateway)**.
- The **workers (Lambda)** process the request and check the **inventory (DynamoDB)** to ensure the item is available.
- The **cash register (RDS)** records the transaction once the order is confirmed.
- The **delivery system (SNS)** sends the customer a confirmation email.
- The **security guard (IAM)** ensures everything happens securely.
- The **traffic director (CloudFront)** ensures the website loads quickly for all customers.

---
## Clean Up
To dismantle the infrastructure established by your Terraform configurations, follow these steps:

#### 1. Navigate to Your Terraform Configuration Directory
- Empty the S3 Bucket:
```bash
aws s3 rm s3://t2s-dev-frontend --recursive
aws s3api delete-objects --bucket t2s-dev-frontend \
--delete "$(aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket t2s-dev-frontend --query '{Objects: Versions[].{Key:Key,VersionId:VersionId}}')"
```

- Open your terminal and change to the directory containing your Terraform configuration files:
```bash
cd path/to/your/terraform/configuration
```

#### 2. Execute the Destroy Command

Initiate the destruction of the managed infrastructure:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

Terraform will generate an execution plan detailing the resources slated for destruction. Review this plan carefully. If you approve, confirm the operation when prompted.

#### 3. Automate Approval (Optional)

To bypass manual confirmation, especially useful in automated scripts or CI/CD pipelines, use the -auto-approve flag:
```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

#### 4. Target Specific Resources (Optional)

If you intend to destroy only particular resources, employ the -target flag:
```bash
terraform destroy -target=aws_instance.example
```
Replace aws_instance.example with the specific resource address.

#### 5. Post-Destruction Verification

After you complete it, please verify through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI that all intended resources have been terminated.

**Important Considerations**

- Data Persistence: Resources like S3 buckets might retain data even after deletion. Please make sure all data is properly backed up or removed as necessary.
- State File Management: The Terraform state file (terraform.tfstate) records the infrastructure’s state. Post-destruction, this file will reflect the absence of managed resources.
- Manual Modifications: If any resources were altered or removed manually outside of Terraform, update the state using commands like ***terraform state rm*** to prevent discrepancies.
